            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>We value our community, and we want to keep it fun, positive and safe; so we developed these guidelines for participating in the community in a way that keeps it such.

If you see a creation on Imaginify that you think violates these guidelines, you can report it. Reported comments and creations will be reviewed by moderators.

Repeat violations of these guidelines will result in a community ban (you won t be able to publish creations, but you can still create). Particularly egregious violations may result in your account being disabled entirely.</p>

            <h2>2. How to behave on Imaginify</h2>
            <p>For the most part, it is as simple as not breaking the rules below.
            We highly recommend NOT sharing any personal information (E.g. your phone number, address, bank account details, etc) in creations prompts. </p>

            <h2>3.DALLE Policy</h2>
            <p>Use of the DALLÂ·E 2 algorithm is subject to OpenAI Content Policy. Unlike our other algorithms, creations must be G-rated, and you are not allowed to create images of celebrities or public figures.
Please read the full OpenAI Content Policy.</p>
